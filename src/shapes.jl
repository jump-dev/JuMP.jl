"""
    AbstractShape

Abstract vectorizable shape. Given a flat vector form of an object of shape
`shape`, the original object can be obtained by [`reshape_vector`](@ref).
"""
abstract type AbstractShape end

"""
    dual_shape(shape::AbstractShape)::AbstractShape

Returns the shape of the dual space of the space of objects of shape `shape`. By
default, the `dual_shape` of a shape is itself. See the examples section below
for an example for which this is not the case.

## Examples

Consider polynomial constraints for which the dual is moment constraints and
moment constraints for which the dual is polynomial constraints. Shapes for
polynomials can be defined as follows:
```julia
struct Polynomial
    coefficients::Vector{Float64}
    monomials::Vector{Monomial}
end
struct PolynomialShape <: AbstractShape
    monomials::Vector{Monomial}
end
JuMP.reshape_vector(x::Vector, shape::PolynomialShape) = Polynomial(x, shape.monomials)
```
and a shape for moments can be defined as follows:
```julia
struct Moments
    coefficients::Vector{Float64}
    monomials::Vector{Monomial}
end
struct MomentsShape <: AbstractShape
    monomials::Vector{Monomial}
end
JuMP.reshape_vector(x::Vector, shape::MomentsShape) = Moments(x, shape.monomials)
```
Then `dual_shape` allows the definition of the shape of the dual of polynomial
and moment constraints:
```julia
dual_shape(shape::PolynomialShape) = MomentsShape(shape.monomials)
dual_shape(shape::MomentsShape) = PolynomialShape(shape.monomials)
```
"""
dual_shape(shape::AbstractShape) = shape

"""
    reshape_set(vectorized_set::MOI.AbstractSet, shape::AbstractShape)

Return a set in its original shape `shape` given its vectorized form
`vectorized_form`.

## Examples

Given a [`SymmetricMatrixShape`](@ref) of vectorized form
`[1, 2, 3] in MOI.PositiveSemidefinieConeTriangle(2)`, the
following code returns the set of the original constraint
`Symmetric(Matrix[1 2; 2 3]) in PSDCone()`:

```jldoctest
julia> reshape_set(MOI.PositiveSemidefiniteConeTriangle(2), SymmetricMatrixShape(2))
PSDCone()
```
"""
function reshape_set end

"""
    reshape_vector(vectorized_form::Vector, shape::AbstractShape)

Return an object in its original shape `shape` given its vectorized form
`vectorized_form`.

## Examples

Given a [`SymmetricMatrixShape`](@ref) of vectorized form `[1, 2, 3]`, the
following code returns the matrix `Symmetric(Matrix[1 2; 2 3])`:

```jldoctest
julia> reshape_vector([1, 2, 3], SymmetricMatrixShape(2))
2×2 LinearAlgebra.Symmetric{Int64,Array{Int64,2}}:
 1  2
 2  3
```
"""
function reshape_vector end

"""
    shape(c::AbstractConstraint)::AbstractShape

Return the shape of the constraint `c`.
"""
function shape end

"""
    ScalarShape

Shape of scalar constraints.
"""
struct ScalarShape <: AbstractShape end
reshape_vector(α, ::ScalarShape) = α

"""
    VectorShape

Vector for which the vectorized form corresponds exactly to the vector given.
"""
struct VectorShape <: AbstractShape end
reshape_vector(vectorized_form, ::VectorShape) = vectorized_form
vectorize(x, ::VectorShape) = x
