A method should be added for any JuMP extension storing data in the `ext` field.

    copy_model(model::Model; filter_constraints::Union{Nothing, Function}=nothing)

Return a copy of the model `model` and a [`ReferenceMap`](@ref) that can be used
to obtain the variable and constraint reference of the new model corresponding
to a given `model`'s reference. A [`Base.copy(::AbstractModel)`](@ref) method
has also been implemented, it is similar to `copy_model` but does not return
the reference map.

If the `filter_constraints` argument is given, only the constraints for which
this function returns `true` will be copied. This function is given a
constraint reference as argument.

## Note

Model copy is not supported in `DIRECT` mode, i.e. when a model is constructed
using the [`direct_model`](@ref) constructor instead of the [`Model`](@ref)
constructor. Moreover, independently on whether an optimizer was provided at
model construction, the new model will have no optimizer, i.e., an optimizer
will have to be provided to the new model in the [`optimize!`](@ref) call.

## Examples

In the following example, a model `model` is constructed with a variable `x` and
a constraint `cref`. It is then copied into a model `new_model` with the new
references assigned to `x_new` and `cref_new`.
```julia
model = Model()
@variable(model, x)
@constraint(model, cref, x == 2)

new_model, reference_map = copy_model(model)
x_new = reference_map[x]
cref_new = reference_map[cref]

Return a copy of the current conflict for the model `model` and a

This is a convenience function that provides a filtering function for

## Examples

In the following example, a model `model` is constructed with a variable `x` and
two constraints `cref` and `cref2`. This model has no solution, as the two
constraints are mutually exclusive. The solver is asked to compute a conflict
with [`compute_conflict!`](@ref). The parts of `model` participating in the
conflict are then copied into a model `new_model`.
