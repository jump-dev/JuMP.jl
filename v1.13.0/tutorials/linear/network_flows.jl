# # Network flow problems

# **This tutorial was originally contributed by Arpit Bhatia.**

# In graph theory, a flow network (also known as a transportation network) is a
# directed graph where each edge has a capacity and each edge receives a flow.
# The amount of flow on an edge cannot exceed the capacity of the edge.

# Often in operations research, a directed graph is called a network, the
# vertices are called nodes and the edges are called arcs.

# A flow must satisfy the restriction that the amount of flow into a node equals
# the amount of flow out of it,  unless it is a source, which has only outgoing
# flow, or sink, which has only incoming flow.

# A network can be used to model traffic in a computer network, circulation with
# demands, fluids in pipes,  currents in an electrical circuit, or anything
# similar in which something travels through a network of nodes.

# This tutorial requires the following packages:

using JuMP
import HiGHS

# ## The shortest path problem

# Suppose that each arc $(i, j)$ of a graph is assigned a scalar cost $a_{i,j}$,
# and suppose that we define the cost of a forward path to be the sum of the
# costs of its arcs.

# Given a pair of nodes, the shortest path problem is to find a forward path
# that connects these nodes and has minimum cost.

# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# \min && \sum_{\forall e(i,j) \in E} a_{i,j} \times x_{i,j} \\
# s.t. && \sum_j x_{ij} - \sum_k x_{ki} = b_i && \forall i\\
# && x_{e} \in \{0,1\} && \forall e \in E
# \end{aligned}
# ```
# where ``b_i`` is ``1`` if ``i`` is the starting node, ``-1`` if ``i`` is the
# ending node, and ``0`` otherwise.

# ## The assignment problem

# Suppose that there are $n$ persons and $n$ objects that we have to match on a
# one-to-one basis. There is a benefit or value $a_{i,j}$ for matching person
# $i$ with object $j$, and we want to assign persons to objects so as to
# maximize the total benefit.

# There is also a restriction that person $i$ can be assigned to object $j$ only
# if $(i, j)$ belongs to a given set of pairs $A$.

# Mathematically, we want to find a set of person-object pairs
# $(1, j_{1}),..., (n, j_{n})$ from $A$ such that the objects $j_{1},...,j_{n}$
# are all distinct, and the total benefit $\sum_{i=1}^{y} a_{ij_{i}}$ is
# maximized.

# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# \max && \sum_{(i,j) \in A} a_{i,j} \times y_{i,j} \\
# s.t. && \sum_{\{j|(i,j) \in A\}} y_{i,j} = 1 && \forall i = \{1,2....n\} \\
# && \sum_{\{i|(i,j) \in A\}} y_{i,j} = 1 && \forall j = \{1,2....n\} \\
# && y_{i,j} \in \{0,1\} && \forall (i,j) \in \{1,2...k\}
# \end{aligned}

# ## The max-flow problem

# In the max-flow problem, we have a graph with two special nodes: the $source$,
# denoted by $s$, and the $sink$, denoted by $t$.

# The objective is to move as much flow as possible from $s$ into $t$ while
# observing the capacity constraints.

# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# \max && \sum_{v:(s,v) \in E} f(s,v) \\
# s.t. && \sum_{u:(u,v) \in E} f(u,v)  = \sum_{w:(v,w) \in E} f(v,w) && \forall v \in V - \{s,t\} \\
# && f(u,v) \leq c(u,v) && \forall (u,v) \in E \\
# && f(u,v) \geq 0 && \forall (u,v) \in E
