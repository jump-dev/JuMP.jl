JuMP is undergoing a major transition to MathOptInterface, and the documentation is in the process of being rewritten. The development version is alpha-quality with breaking changes still in progress. Please provide feedback and file issues if you use this branch.JuMP is a domain-specific modeling language for mathematical optimization embedded in Julia. It currently supports a number of open-source and commercial solvers (see below) for a variety of problem classes, including linear programming, mixed-integer programming, second-order conic programming, semidefinite programming, and nonlinear programming. JuMP\'s features include:User friendliness\nSyntax that mimics natural mathematical expressions.\nComplete documentation (WIP!)\nSpeed\nBenchmarking has shown that JuMP can create problems at similar speeds   to special-purpose modeling languages such as   AMPL.\nJuMP communicates with most solvers in memory, avoiding the need to   write intermediary files.\nSolver independence\nJuMP uses a generic solver-independent interface provided by the   MathOptInterface   package, making it easy to change between a number of open-source and   commercial optimization software packages (\"solvers\").\nCurrently supported solvers include   Artelys Knitro,   Bonmin,   Cbc,   Clp,   Couenne,   CPLEX,   ECOS,   FICO Xpress,   GLPK,   Gurobi,   Ipopt,   MOSEK,   NLopt, and   SCS.\nAccess to advanced algorithmic techniques\nIncluding efficient LP re-solves which previously required using   solver-specific and/or low-level C++ libraries.\nEase of embedding\nJuMP itself is written purely in Julia. Solvers are the only binary   dependencies.\nBeing embedded in a general-purpose programming language makes it easy   to solve optimization problems as part of a larger workflow (e.g.,   inside a simulation, behind a web server, or as a subproblem in a   decomposition algorithm).\nAs a trade-off, JuMP\'s syntax is constrained by the syntax available   in Julia.\nJuMP is MPL licensed, meaning that   it can be embedded in commercial software that complies with the terms   of the license.While neither Julia nor JuMP have reached version 1.0 yet, the releases are stable enough for everyday use and are being used in a number of research projects and neat applications by a growing community of users who are early adopters. JuMP remains under active development, and we welcome your feedback, suggestions, and bug reports."

    "text": "This quick start guide will introduce the main concepts of JuMP. If you are familiar with another modeling language embedded in a high-level language such as PuLP (Python) or a solver-specific interface you will find most of this familiar. If you are coming from an AMPL or similar background, you may find some of the concepts novel but the general appearance will still be familiar.The example in this guide is deliberately kept simple. There are more complex examples in the JuMP/examples/ folder.Once JuMP is installed, to use JuMP in your programs, you just need to say:julia> using JuMPYou also need to include a Julia package which provides an appropriate solver. One such solver is GLPK.Optimizer, which is provided by the GLPK.jl package.julia> using GLPKSee Installation Guide for a list of other solvers you can use.Models are created with the Model() function. The with_optimizer syntax is used to specify the optimizer to be used:julia> model = Model(with_optimizer(GLPK.Optimizer))\nA JuMP ModelDocTestSetup = quote\n    # Using a caching optimizer removes the need to # load a solver such as GLPK\n    # for building the documentation.\n    const MOI = JuMP.MathOptInterface\n    model = Model(with_optimizer(MOI.Utilities.MockOptimizer,\n                                 JuMP.JuMPMOIModel{Float64}(),\n                                 eval_objective_value = false,\n                                 eval_variable_constraint_dual = false))\nendnote: Note\nYour model doesn\'t have to be called model - it\'s just a name.There are a few options for defining a variable, depending on whether you want to have lower bounds, upper bounds, both bounds, or even no bounds. The following commands will create two variables, x and y, with both lower and upper bounds. Note the first argument is our model variable model. These variables are associated with this model and cannot be used in another model.julia> @variable(model, 0 <= x <= 2)\nx\n\njulia> @variable(model, 0 <= y <= 30)\nySee the Variables section for more information on creating variables.DocTestSetup = nothingNext we\'ll set our objective. Note again the model, so we know which model\'s objective we are setting! The objective sense, Max or Min, should be provided as the second argument. Note also that we don\'t have a multiplication * symbol between 5 and our variable x - Julia is smart enough to not need it! Feel free to stick with * if it makes you feel more comfortable, as we have done with 3 * y. (We have been intentionally inconsistent here to demonstrate different syntax; however, it is good practice to pick one way or the other consistently in your code.)julia> @objective(model, Max, 5x + 3 * y)Adding constraints is a lot like setting the objective. Here we create a less-than-or-equal-to constraint using <=, but we can also create equality constraints using == and greater-than-or-equal-to constraints with >=:julia> @constraint(model, con, 1x + 5y <= 3)\ncon : x + 5 y <= 3.0Note that in a similar manner to the @variable macro, we have named the constraint con. This will bind the constraint to the Julia variable con for later analysis.Models are solved with the JuMP.optimize! function:julia> JuMP.optimize!(model)DocTestSetup = quote\n    # Now we load in the solution. Using a caching optimizer removes the need to\n    # load a solver such as GLPK for building the documentation.\n    mock = JuMP.caching_optimizer(model).optimizer\n    MOI.set(mock, MOI.TerminationStatus(), MOI.Success)\n    MOI.set(mock, MOI.PrimalStatus(), MOI.FeasiblePoint)\n    MOI.set(mock, MOI.DualStatus(), MOI.FeasiblePoint)\n    MOI.set(mock, MOI.ResultCount(), 1)\n    MOI.set(mock, MOI.ObjectiveValue(), 10.6)\n    MOI.set(mock, MOI.VariablePrimal(), JuMP.optimizer_index(x), 2.0)\n    MOI.set(mock, MOI.VariablePrimal(), JuMP.optimizer_index(y), 0.2)\n    MOI.set(mock, MOI.ConstraintDual(), JuMP.optimizer_index(con), -0.6)\n    MOI.set(mock, MOI.ConstraintDual(), JuMP.optimizer_index(JuMP.UpperBoundRef(x)), -4.4)\n    MOI.set(mock, MOI.ConstraintDual(), JuMP.optimizer_index(JuMP.LowerBoundRef(y)), 0.0)\nendAfter the call to JuMP.optimize! has finished, we need to understand why the optimizer stopped. This can be for a number of reasons. First, the solver might have found the optimal solution, or proved that the problem is infeasible. However, it might also have run into numerical difficulties, or terminated due to a setting such as a time limit. We can ask the solver why it stopped using the JuMP.termination_status function:julia> JuMP.termination_status(model)\nSuccess::TerminationStatusCode = 0In this case, GLPK returned Success. This does not mean that it has found the optimal solution. Instead, it indicates that GLPK has finished running and did not encounter any errors or user-provided termination limits.DocTestSetup = nothingTo understand the reason for termination in more detail, we need to query JuMP.primalstatus:julia> JuMP.primal_status(model)\nFeasiblePoint::ResultStatusCode = 1This indicates that GLPK has found a FeasiblePoint to the primal problem. Coupled with the Success from JuMP.termination_status, we can infer that GLPK has indeed found the optimal solution. We can also query JuMP.dual_status:julia> JuMP.dual_status(model)\nFeasiblePoint::ResultStatusCode = 1Like the primal_status, GLPK indicates that it has found a FeasiblePoint to the dual problem.Finally, we can query the result of the optimization. First, we can query the objective value:julia> JuMP.objective_value(model)\n10.6We can also query the primal result values of the x and y variables:julia> JuMP.result_value(x)\n2.0\n\njulia> JuMP.result_value(y)\n0.2We can also query the value of the dual variable associated with the constraint con (which we bound to a Julia variable when defining the constraint):julia> JuMP.result_dual(con)\n-0.6To query the dual variables associated with the variable bounds, things are a little trickier as we first need to obtain a reference to the constraint:julia> x_upper = JuMP.UpperBoundRef(x)\nx <= 2.0\n\njulia> JuMP.result_dual(x_upper)\n-4.4A similar process can be followed to obtain the dual of the lower bound constraint on y:julia> y_lower = JuMP.LowerBoundRef(y)\ny >= 0.0\n\njulia> JuMP.result_dual(y_lower)\n0.0"

    "title": "What is a JuMP variable?",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "The term variable in mathematical optimization has many meanings. Here, we distinguish between the following three types of variables:optimization variables, which are the mathematical x in the problem maxf_0(x)  f_i(x) in S_i.\nJulia variables, which are bindings between a name and a value, for example x = 1. (See here for the Julia docs.)\nJuMP variables, which are instances of the JuMP.VariableRef struct defined by JuMP that contains a reference to an optimization variable in a model. (Extra for experts: the VariableRef struct is a thin wrapper around a MOI.VariableIndex, and also contains a reference to the JuMP model.)To illustrate these three types of variables, consider the following JuMP code (the full syntax is explained below):julia> model = Model()\nA JuMP Model\n\njulia> @variable(model, x[1:2])\n2-element Array{VariableRef,1}:\n x[1]\n x[2]This code does three things:it adds two optimization variables to model\nit creates two JuMP variables that act as references to those optimization variables\nit binds those JuMP variables as a vector with two elements to the Julia variable x.To reduce confusion, we will attempt, where possible, to always refer to variables with their corresponding prefix.warn: Warn\nCreating two JuMP variables with the same name results in an error at runtime.JuMP variables can have attributes, such as names or an initial primal start value. We illustrate the name attribute in the following example:julia> @variable(model, y, base_name=\"decision variable\")\ndecision variableThis code does four things:it adds one optimization variable to model\nit creates one JuMP variable that acts as a reference to that optimization variable\nit binds the JuMP variable to the Julia variable y\nit tells JuMP that the name attribute of this JuMP variable is \"decisionvariable\". JuMP uses the value of base_name when it has to print the variable as a string.For example, when we print y at the REPL we get:julia> y\ndecision variableBecause y is a Julia variable, we can bind it to a different value. For example, if we write:julia> y = 1\n1y is no longer a binding to a JuMP variable. This does not mean that the JuMP variable has been destroyed. It still exists and is still a reference to the same optimization variable. The binding can be reset by querying the model for the symbol as it was written in the @variable macro. For example:julia> model[:y]\ndecision variableThis act of looking up the JuMP variable by using the symbol is most useful when composing JuMP models across multiple functions, as illustrated by the following example:function add_component_to_model(model::JuMP.Model)\n    x = model[:x]\n    # ... code that uses x\nend\nfunction build_model()\n    model = Model()\n    @variable(model, x)\n    add_component_to_model(model)\nend\n# TODO(@odow): add a section on looking up by stringNow that we understand the difference between optimization, JuMP, and Julia variables, we can introduce more of the functionality of the @variable macro."

    "text": "We have already seen the basic usage of the @variable macro. The next extension is to add lower- and upper-bounds to each optimization variable.

Putting the name on the right-hand side will result in an error. For example:@variable(model, 1 <= x)  # works\na = 1\n@variable(model, a <= x)  # errorsWe can query whether an optimization variable has a lower- or upper-bound via the JuMP.has_lower_bound and JuMP.has_upper_bound functions. For example:julia> JuMP.has_lower_bound(x_free)\nfalse\n\njulia> JuMP.has_upper_bound(x_upper)\ntrueIf a variable has a lower or upper bound, we can query the value of it via the JuMP.lower_bound and JuMP.upper_bound functions. For example:julia> JuMP.lower_bound(x_interval)\n2.0\n\njulia> JuMP.upper_bound(x_interval)\n3.0Querying the value of a bound that does not exist will result in an error.Instead of using the <= and >= syntax, we can also use the lower_bound and upper_bound keyword arguments. For example:julia> @variable(model, x, lower_bound=1, upper_bound=2)\nx\n\njulia> JuMP.lower_bound(x)\n1.0Another option is to use the JuMP.set_lower_bound and JuMP.set_upper_bound functions. These can also be used to modify an existing variable bound. For example:julia> @variable(model, x >= 1)\nx\n\njulia> JuMP.lower_bound(x)\n1.0\n\njulia> JuMP.set_lower_bound(x, 2)\n\njulia> JuMP.lower_bound(x)\n2.0Finally, we can delete variable bounds using JuMP.delete_lower_bound and JuMP.delete_upper_bound:julia> @variable(model, 1 <= x <= 2)\nx\n\njulia> JuMP.lower_bound(x)\n1.0\n\njulia> JuMP.delete_lower_bound(x)\n\njulia> JuMP.has_lower_bound(x)\nfalse\n\njulia> JuMP.upper_bound(x)\n2.0\n\njulia> JuMP.delete_upper_bound(x)\n\njulia> JuMP.has_upper_bound(x)\nfalse"

For example:julia> @variable(model, x[1:2, [:A,:B]])\n2-dimensional JuMPArray{VariableRef,2,...} with index sets:\n    Dimension 1, 1:2\n    Dimension 2, Symbol[:A, :B]\nAnd data, a 2Ã2 Array{VariableRef,2}:\n x[1,A]  x[1,B]\n x[2,A]  x[2,B]JuMPArray\'s can be indexed and sliced as follows:julia> x[1, :A]\nx[1,A]\n\njulia> x[2, :]\n1-dimensional JuMPArray{VariableRef,1,...} with index sets:\n    Dimension 1, Symbol[:A, :B]\nAnd data, a 2-element Array{VariableRef,1}:\n x[2,A]\n x[2,B]Similarly to the Array case, the indices in a JuMPArray can be named, and the bounds can depend upon these names. For example:julia> @variable(model, x[i=2:3, j=1:2:3] >= 0.5i + j)\n2-dimensional JuMPArray{VariableRef,2,...} with index sets:\n    Dimension 1, 2:3\n    Dimension 2, 1:2:3\nAnd data, a 2Ã2 Array{VariableRef,2}:\n x[2,1]  x[2,3]\n x[3,1]  x[3,3]\n\njulia> JuMP.lower_bound.(x)\n2-dimensional JuMPArray{Float64,2,...} with index sets:\n    Dimension 1, 2:3\n    Dimension 2, 1:2:3\nAnd data, a 2Ã2 Array{Float64,2}:\n 2.0  4.0\n 2.5  4.5"

    "text": "The third datatype that JuMP supports the efficient creation of are dictionaries. These dictionaries are created when the indices do not form a rectangular set. One example is when indices have a dependence upon previous indices (called triangular indexing). JuMP supports this as follows:julia> @variable(model, x[i=1:2, j=i:2])\nDict{Any,VariableRef} with 3 entries:\n  (1, 2) => x[1,2]\n  (2, 2) => x[2,2]\n  (1, 1) => x[1,1]x is a standard Julia dictionary. Therefore, slicing cannot be performed.We can also conditionally create variables via a JuMP-specific syntax. This sytax appends a comparison check that depends upon the named indices and is separated from the indices by a semi-colon (;).

    "text": "When creating a container of JuMP variables, JuMP will attempt to choose the tightest container type that can store the JuMP variables. Thus, it will prefer to create an Array before a JuMPArray, and a JuMPArray before a dictionary. However, because this happens at compile time, it does not always make the best choice. To illustrate this, consider the following example:julia> A = 1:2\n1:2\n\njulia> @variable(model, x[A])\n1-dimensional JuMPArray{VariableRef,1,...} with index sets:\n    Dimension 1, 1:2\nAnd data, a 2-element Array{VariableRef,1}:\n x[1]\n x[2]Since the value (and type) of A is unknown at compile time, JuMP is unable to infer that A is a one-based integer range. Therefore, JuMP creates a JuMPArray, even though it could store these two variables in a standard one-dimensional Array.We can share our knowledge that it is possible to store these JuMP variables as an array by setting the container keyword:julia> @variable(model, y[A], container=Array)\n2-element Array{VariableRef,1}:\n y[1]\n y[2]JuMP now creates a vector of JuMP variables, instead of a JuMPArray. Note that choosing an invalid container type will throw an error."

JuMP can be viewed as a lightweight user-friendly layer on top of the MOI backend:JuMP does not maintain any copy of the model outside this MOI backend.\nJuMP variable (resp. constraint) references are simple structures containing both a reference to the JuMP model and the MOI index of the variable (resp. constraint).\nJuMP gives the constraints to the MOI backend in the form provided by the user without doing any automatic reformulation.\nvariables additions, constraints additions/modifications and objective modifications are directly applied to the MOI backend thus expecting the backend to support such modifications.While this allows JuMP to be a thin wrapper on top of the solver API, as mentioned in the last point above, this seems rather demanding on the solver. Indeed, while some solvers support incremental building of the model and modifications before and after solve, other solvers only support the model being copied at once before solve. Moreover it seems to require all solvers to implement all possible reformulations independently which seems both very ambitious and might generate a lot of duplicated code.These apparent limitations are in fact addressed at the MOI level in a manner that is completely transparent to JuMP. While the MOI API may seem very demanding, it allows MOI models to be a succession of lightweight MOI layers that fill the gap between JuMP requirements and the solver capabilities.JuMP models can be created in three different modes: Automatic, Manual and Direct."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "JuMP\'s library of recognized univariate functions is derived from the Calculus.jl package. If you encounter a standard special function not currently supported by JuMP, consider contributing to the list of derivative rules there. In addition to this built-in list of functions, it is possible to register custom (user-defined) nonlinear functions to use within nonlinear expressions. JuMP does not support black-box optimization, so all user-defined functions must provide derivatives in some form. Fortunately, JuMP supports automatic differentiation of user-defined functions, a feature to our knowledge not available in any comparable modeling systems.Automatic differentiation is not finite differencing. JuMP\'s automatically computed derivatives are not subject to approximation error.JuMP uses ForwardDiff.jl to perform automatic differentiation; see the ForwardDiff.jl documentation for a description of how to write a function suitable for automatic differentiation. The general guideline is to write code that is generic with respect to the number type; don\'t assume that the input to the function is Float64. To register a user-defined function with derivatives computed by automatic differentiation, use the JuMP.register method as in the following example:my_square(x) = x ^ 2\nmy_f(x,y) = (x - 1) ^ 2 + (y - 2) ^ 2\n\nmodel = Model()\n\nJuMP.register(model, :my_f, 2, my_f, autodiff=true)\nJuMP.register(model, :my_square, 1, my_square, autodiff=true)\n\n@variable(model, x[1:2] >= 0.5)\n@NLobjective(model, Min, my_f(x[1], my_square(x[2])))The above code creates a JuMP model with the objective function (x[1] - 1) ^ 2 + (x[2] ^ 2 - 2) ^ 2. The first argument to JuMP.register the model for which the functions are registered. The second argument is a Julia symbol object which serves as the name of the user-defined function in JuMP expressions; the JuMP name need not be the same as the name of the corresponding Julia method. The third argument specifies how many arguments the function takes. The fourth argument is the name of the Julia method which computes the function, and autodiff=true instructs JuMP to compute exact gradients automatically.note: Note\nAll arguments to user-defined functions are scalars, not vectors. To define a function which takes a large number of arguments, you may use the splatting syntax f(x...) = ....Forward-mode automatic differentiation as implemented by ForwardDiff.jl has a computational cost that scales linearly with the number of input dimensions. As such, it is not the most efficient way to compute gradients of user-defined functions if the number of input arguments is large. In this case, users may want to provide their own routines for evaluating gradients. The more general syntax for JuMP.register which accepts user-provided derivative evaluation routines is:JuMP.register(model::Model, s::Symbol, dimension::Integer, f::Function,\n              âf::Function, âÂ²f::Function)The input differs for functions which take a single input argument and functions which take more than one. For univariate functions, the derivative evaluation routines should return a number which represents the first and second-order derivatives respectively. For multivariate functions, the derivative evaluation routines will be passed a gradient vector which they must explicitly fill. Second-order derivatives of multivariate functions are not currently supported; this argument should be omitted. The following example sets up the same optimization problem as before, but now we explicitly provide evaluation routines for the user-defined functions:my_square(x) = x ^ 2\nmy_square_prime(x) = 2x\nmy_square_prime_prime(x) = 2\n\nmy_f(x, y) = (x - 1) ^ 2 + (y - 2) ^ 2\nfunction âf(g, x, y)\n    g[1] = 2 * (x - 1)\n    g[2] = 2 * (y - 2)\nend\n\nmodel = Model()\n\nJuMP.register(model, :my_f, 2, my_f, âf)\nJuMP.register(model, :my_square, 1, my_square, my_square_prime,\n              my_square_prime_prime)\n\n@variable(model, x[1:2] >= 0.5)\n@NLobjective(model, Min, my_f(x[1], my_square(x[2])))"

For other solvers, see their respective documentation for performance tips.The function evaluation time, on the other hand, is the responsibility of the modeling language.

Internally, JuMP implements the AbstractNLPEvaluator interface from MathOptInterface. To obtain an NLP evaluator object from a JuMP model, use JuMP.NLPEvaluator. JuMP.index returns the MOI.VariableIndex corresponding to a JuMP variable. MOI.VariableIndex itself is a type-safe wrapper for Int64 (stored in the value field.)For example:MOI = JuMP.MathOptInterface\nraw_index(v::MOI.VariableIndex) = v.value\nmodel = Model()\n@variable(model, x)\n@variable(model, y)\n@NLobjective(model, Min, sin(x) + sin(y))\nvalues = zeros(2)\nx_index = raw_index(JuMP.index(x))\ny_index = raw_index(JuMP.index(y))\nvalues[x_index] = 2.0\nvalues[y_index] = 3.0\nd = JuMP.NLPEvaluator(model)\nMOI.initialize(d, [:Grad])\nMOI.eval_objective(d, values) # == sin(2.0) + sin(3.0)\n\n# output\n1.0504174348855488âf = zeros(2)\nMOI.eval_objective_gradient(d, âf, values)\n(âf[x_index], âf[y_index]) # == (cos(2.0), cos(3.0))\n\n# output\n(-0.4161468365471424, -0.9899924966004454)Only nonlinear constraints (those added with @NLconstraint), and nonlinear objectives (added with @NLobjective) exist in the scope of the NLPEvaluator. The NLPEvaluator does not evaluate derivatives of linear or quadratic constraints or objectives. The index method applied to a nonlinear constraint reference object returns its index as a NonlinearConstraintIndex. The value field of NonlinearConstraintIndex stores the raw integer index. For example:julia> model = Model();\n\njulia> @variable(model, x);\n\njulia> @NLconstraint(model, cons1, sin(x) <= 1);\n\njulia> @NLconstraint(model, cons2, x + 5 == 10);\n\njulia> typeof(cons1)\nConstraintRef{Model,JuMP.NonlinearConstraintIndex,JuMP.ScalarShape}\n\njulia> JuMP.index(cons1)\nJuMP.NonlinearConstraintIndex(1)\n\njulia> JuMP.index(cons2)\nJuMP.NonlinearConstraintIndex(2)TODO: Provide a link for how to access the linear and quadratic parts of the model.Note that for one-sided nonlinear constraints, JuMP subtracts any values on the right-hand side when computing expressions. In other words, one-sided nonlinear constraints are always transformed to have a right-hand side of zero.This method of querying derivatives directly from a JuMP model is convenient for interacting with the model in a structured way, e.g., for accessing derivatives of specific variables. For example, in statistical maximum likelihood estimation problems, one is often interested in the Hessian matrix at the optimal solution, which can be queried using the JuMP.NLPEvaluator."

For consistency, always use underscores in variable names and function names to separate words."

We recommend to:Omit ! when the name itself makes it clear that modification is taking place, e.g., add_constraint and set_name. We depart from the Julia style guide because ! does not provide a reader with any additional information in this case, and adherence to this convention is not uniform even in base Julia itself (consider Base.println and Base.finalize).\nUse ! in all other cases. In particular it can be used to distinguish between modifying and non-modifying variants of the same function like scale and scale!.Note that ! is not a self-documenting feature because it is still ambiguous which arguments are modified when multiple arguments are present. Be sure to document which arguments are modified in the method\'s docstring.See also the Julia style guide recommendations for ordering of function arguments."

To suppress output with Gurobi, for example, one would saym = Model(solver=GurobiSolver(OutputFlag=0))When a solver is not specified, i.e., the model is created with m = Model(),  there\'s no option to suppress output. A workaround is to redirect STDOUT before  and after the call to solve(m):TT = STDOUT # save original STDOUT stream\nredirect_stdout()\nsolve(m)\nredirect_stdout(TT) # restore STDOUT"
