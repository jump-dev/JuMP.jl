# This tutorial demonstrates how to formulate basic power systems engineering
# models in JuMP using a 3 bus example.

# We will consider basic "economic dispatch" and "unit commitment" models
# without taking into account transmission constraints.

# ## Illustrative example

# In the following notes for the sake of simplicity, we are going to use a three
# bus example mirroring the interface between Western and Eastern Texas. This
# example is taken from R. Baldick, "[Wind and Energy Markets: A Case Study of Texas](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2011.2162798),"
# IEEE Systems Journal, vol. 6, pp. 27-34, 2012.

# ![Power Systems](../../assets/power_systems.png)

# For this example, we set the following characteristics of generators,
# transmission lines, wind farms and demands:

# | Quantity         | Generator 1 | Generator 2 |
# |:-----------------|:-----------:|------------:|
# | $g_{min}$, MW    | 0           | 300         |
# | $g_{max}$, MW    | 1000        | 1000        |
# | $c^g$, \$/MWh    | 50          | 100         |
# | $c^{g0}$, \$/MWh | 1000        | 0           |

# | Quantity      | Line 1 | Line 2 |
# |:--------------|:------:|-------:|
# | $f^{max}$, MW | 100    | 1000   |
# | $x$, p.u.     | 0.001  | 0.001  |

# | Quantity        | Wind farm 1 | Wind farm 2 |
# |:----------------|:-----------:|------------:|
# | $w^{f}$, MW     | 150         | 50          |
# | $c^{w}$, \$/MWh | 50          | 50          |

# | Quantity | Bus 1 | Bus 2 | Bus 3 |
# |:---------|:-----:|:-----:|------:|
# | $d$, MW  | 0     | 0     | 15000 |

# ## Economic dispatch

# Economic dispatch (ED) is an optimization problem that minimizes the cost of
# supplying energy demand subject to operational constraints on power system
# assets. In its simplest modification, ED is an LP problem solved for an
# aggregated load and wind forecast and for a single infinitesimal moment.

# Mathematically, the ED problem can be written as follows:

# ```math
# \min \sum_{i \in I} c^g_{i} \cdot g_{i} + c^w \cdot w,
# ```

# where $c_{i}$ and $g_{i}$ are the incremental cost (\$/MWh) and power output
# (MW) of the $i^{th}$ generator, respectively, and $c^w$ and $w$ are the
# incremental cost (\$/MWh) and wind power injection (MW), respectively.

# Subject to the constraints:

# * Minimum ($g^{\min}$) and maximum ($g^{\max}$) limits on power outputs of
#   generators:
#   $g^{\min}_{i} \leq g_{i} \leq g^{\max}_{i}.$
# * Constraint on the wind power injection:
#   $0 \leq w \leq w^f,$
#   where $w$ and $w^f$ are the wind power injection and wind power forecast,
#   respectively.
# * Power balance constraint:
#   $\sum_{i \in I} g_{i} + w = d^f,$
#   where $d^f$ is the demand forecast.

# Further reading on ED models can be found in A. J. Wood, B. F. Wollenberg, and
# G. B. Shebl√©, "Power Generation, Operation and Control", Wiley, 2013.

# Adjusting specific constraints and/or the objective function is faster than
# re-building the entire model.

# ## A few practical limitations of the economic dispatch model

# ### Inefficient usage of wind generators

# The economic dispatch problem does not perform commitment decisions and, thus,
# assumes that all generators must be dispatched at least at their minimum power
# output limit. This approach is not cost efficient and may lead to absurd
# decisions. For example, if $ d = \sum_{i \in I} g^{\min}_{i}$, the wind power
# injection must be zero, i.e. all available wind generation is spilled, to meet
# the minimum power output constraints on generators.

# In the following example, we adjust the total demand and observed how it
# affects wind spillage.

    Symbol("Dispatch of Generators(MW)") => Float64[],
    Symbol("Dispatch of Generator 2(MW)") => Float64[],

# This particular drawback can be overcome by introducing binary decisions on
# the "on/off" status of generators. This model is called unit commitment and
# considered later in these notes.

# For further reading on the interplay between wind generation and the minimum
# power output constraints of generators, we refer interested readers to R.
# Baldick, "Wind and Energy Markets: A Case Study of Texas," IEEE Systems
# Journal, vol. 6, pp. 27-34, 2012.

# ### Transmission-infeasible solution

# The ED solution is entirely market-based and disrespects limitations of the
# transmission network. Indeed, the flows in transmission lines would attain the
# following values:

# ```math
# f_{1-2} = 150 MW \leq f_{1-2}^{\max} = 100 MW
# ```

# ```math
# f_{2-3} = 1200 MW \leq f_{2-3}^{\max} = 1000 MW
# ```

# Thus, if this ED solution was enforced in practice, the power flow limits on
# both lines would be violated. Therefore, in the following section we consider
# the optimal power flow model, which amends the ED model with network
# constraints.

# The importance of the transmission-aware decisions is emphasized in E.
# Lannoye, D. Flynn, and M. O'Malley, "Transmission, Variable Generation, and
# Power System Flexibility," IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, vol. 30, pp.
# 57-66, 2015.

# ## Unit Commitment model

# The Unit Commitment (UC) model can be obtained from ED model by introducing
# binary variable associated with each generator. This binary variable can
# attain two values: if it is "1", the generator is synchronized and, thus, can
# be dispatched, otherwise, i.e. if the binary variable is "0", that generator
# is not synchronized and its power output is set to 0.

# To obtain the mathematical formulation of the UC model, we will modify the
# constraints of the ED model as follows:

# ```math
# g^{\min}_{i} \cdot u_{t,i} \leq g_{i} \leq g^{\max}_{i} \cdot u_{t,i},
# ```
# where $u_{i} \in \{0,1\}.$ In this constraint, if $u_{i} = 0$, then
# $g_{i}  = 0$. On the other hand, if $u_{i} = 1$, then
# $g^{max}_{i} \leq g_{i} \leq g^{min}_{i}$.

# For further reading on the UC problem we refer interested readers to G.
# Morales-Espana, J. M. Latorre, and A. Ramos, "Tight and Compact MILP
# Formulation for the Thermal Unit Commitment Problem," IEEE Transactions on
# Power Systems, vol. 28, pp. 4897-4908, 2013.

# In the following example we convert the ED model explained above to the UC
# model.
