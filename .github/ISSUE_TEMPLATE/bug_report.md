about: Help us track down bugs in JuMP

---

Welcome.

Please read the following before posting a new bug report:

- If you have a question or are unsure if the behavior you're experiencing is a bug, please search or post to our Discourse site: https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/opt. Questions posted to Discourse have broader visibility and are likely to be answered more quickly than issues filed here.

- If you're experiencing a bug that is solver-specific (for example, it only happens when you use Gurobi), the issue is best raised at the relevant solver-wrapper repository (for example, Gurobi.jl). If you are unsure, you should raise the problem on Discourse first.

- If you are reasonably confident your issue is a bug in JuMP, this is the right place. Be sure to include as much relevant information as possible, including a minimal reproducible example. See https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/ for background on how to format text and code on GitHub issues.

Thanks for contributing to JuMP.
