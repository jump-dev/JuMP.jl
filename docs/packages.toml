# Each element in this TOML file has the format:
#
# [PackageName]
#    user = "jump-dev"
#    rev = ""
#    extension = false
#    has_html = false
#    filename = "README.md"
#
# All fields except `rev` are optional, and the default values are those given
# above.
#
# When the JuMP documentation builds, the `docs/make.jl` script will fetch a
# file for each package from the URL:
#   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[user]/[PackageName].jl/[rev]/[filename]
# and add it to the `Solvers` section (if `extension = false`) or the
# `Extensions` section (if `extension = true`) of the JuMP documentation.
#
# Files _must_ be written in Documenter-compatible Markdown, and they _should_
# follow the style of the READMEs of the jump-dev packages.
#
# The `rev` _must_ be a fixed git reference, such as a commit SHA or a tag. It 
# must not be a relative reference such as a branch name.
#
# If you develop a new solver or extension, please add it to this list.
#
# Periodically, we will bump the `rev` of each package to reflect recent
# changes. If any solver or extension becomes unmaintained or incompatible with
# the latest version of JuMP or MathOptInterface, we reserve the right to 
# temporarily remove it from the list until it is updated again.
