# # Classifiers

# The purpose of this tutorial is to show how JuMP can be used to easily 
# formulate classification problems.

# Classification problems deal with constructing functions, called *classifiers*,
# that can efficiently classify data into two or more distinct sets.
# A common application is classifying previously unseen data points
# after training a classifier on known data.

# The theory and models in this tutorial come from Section 9.4
# "Classification Problems" of the book
# [_Linear Programming with MATLAB_](https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9780898718775)
# (2007), by M. C. Ferris, O. L. Mangasarian, and S. J. Wright.

# ## Required packages

# This tutorial uses the following packages

using JuMP
import DelimitedFiles
import Ipopt
import LinearAlgebra
import Plots
import Random
import Test #src

# ## Data and visualisation

# To start, let's generate some points to test with. The argument ``m`` is the
# number of 2-dimensional points:

function generate_test_points(m; random_seed = 1)
    rng = Random.MersenneTwister(random_seed)
    return 2.0 .* rand(rng, Float64, m, 2)
end

# For the sake of the example, let's take ``m = 100``:

P = generate_test_points(100);

# Note that the points are represented row-wise in the generated array. Let's
# visualise the points using the `Plots` package:

r = 1.01 * maximum(abs.(P))
plot = Plots.scatter(
    P[:, 1],
    P[:, 2];
    xlim = (0, r),
    ylim = (0, r),
    label = nothing,
    color = :white,
    shape = :circle,
    size = (600, 600),
    legend = false,
)

# We'll need this for later comparison:

plot_copy = deepcopy(plot);

# We want to split the points into two distinct sets on either side of a
# dividing line. We'll then label each point depending on which side of the line
# it happens to fall. Based on the labels of the point, we'll show how to create
# a classifier using a JuMP model. We can then test how well our classifier
# reproduces the original labels and the boundary between them.

# Let's make a line to divide the points into two sets by defining a gradient and
# constant:

w_0, g_0 = [5, 3], 8
line(v::AbstractArray; w = w_0, g = g_0) = w' * v - g
line(x::Real; w = w_0, g = g_0) = -(w[1] * x - g) / w[2];

# Julia's multiple dispatch feature allows us to define the vector and
# single-variable form of the `line` function under the same name.

# Let's add this to the plot:

Plots.plot!(
    plot,
    x -> line(x),
    0.0:0.01:2.0;
    seriestype = :line,
    linewidth = 5,
    lineopacity = 0.6,
    c = :darkcyan,
)

# Now we label the points relative to which side of the line they are. It is
# numerically useful to have the labels +1 for `P_pos`  and -1 for `P_neg`.

labels = ifelse.(line.(eachrow(P)) .>= 0, 1, -1)
P_pos = P[labels.==1, :]
P_neg = P[labels.==-1, :]
@assert size(P_pos, 1) + size(P_neg, 1) == size(P, 1) #src
Plots.scatter!(
    plot,
    P_pos[:, 1],
    P_pos[:, 2];
    shape = :cross,
    markercolor = :blue,
    markersize = 8,
)
Plots.scatter!(
    plot,
    P_neg[:, 1],
    P_neg[:, 2];
    shape = :xcross,
    markercolor = :crimson,
    markersize = 8,
)

# The goal is to show we can reconstruct the line from *just* the points and
# the labels.

# ## Formulation: linear support vector machine

# A classifier known as the linear _support vector machine_ (SVM) looks for the affine
# function ``L(p) = w^\top p - g`` that satisfies ``L(p) < 0`` for all points ``p``
# in `P_neg` and ``L(p) > 0`` for all points ``p`` in `P_pos`.

# The linearly constrained quadratic program that implements this is:
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# \min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^n, \; g \in \mathbb{R}, \; y \in \mathbb{R}^m} \quad & \frac{1}{2} w^\top w + C \; \sum_{i=1}^m y_i \\
# \text{subject to } \quad & D \cdot (P w - g) + y \geq \mathbf{1} \\
#                   & y \ge 0.
# \end{aligned}
# ```
# where ``D`` is a diagonal matrix of the labels.

# We need a default value for the positive penalty parameter ``C``:

C_0 = 100.0;

# ## JuMP formulation

# Here is the JuMP model:

function solve_SVM_classifier(P, labels; optimizer = Ipopt.Optimizer, C = C_0)
    m, n = size(P)
    model = Model(optimizer)
    set_silent(model)
    @variable(model, w[1:n])
    @variable(model, g)
    @variable(model, y[1:m] >= 0)
    D = LinearAlgebra.Diagonal(labels)
    @constraint(model, D * (P * w .- g) .+ y .>= 1)
    @objective(model, Min, 1 / 2 * w' * w + C * sum(y))
    optimize!(model)
    return model, value.(w), value(g), value.(y)
end

# ## Results

# Let's recover the values that define the classifier by solving the model:

model, w_sol, g_sol, y_sol = solve_SVM_classifier(P, labels)
Test.@test termination_status(model) == LOCALLY_SOLVED    #src
Test.@test primal_status(model) == FEASIBLE_POINT  #src
println("Minimum slack: ", minimum(y_sol), "\nMaximum slack: ", maximum(y_sol))

# With the solution, we can ask: was the value of the penalty constant
# "sufficiently large" for this data set? This can be judged in part by the
# range of the slack variables. If the slack is too large, then we need to
# increase the penalty constant.

# Let's plot the solution and check how we did:

Plots.plot!(
    plot,
    x -> line(x; w = w_sol, g = g_sol),
    0.0:0.01:2.0;
    seriestype = :line,
    linewidth = 5,
    linestyle = :dashdotdot,
    lineopacity = 0.9,
    c = :darkblue,
)

# We find that we have recovered the dividing line from just the information of
# the points and their labels.

# ## Nonseparable classes of points

# Now, what if the point sets are not cleanly separable by a line
# (or a hyperplane in higher dimensions)? Does this still work?
# Let's repeat the above process but this time we will simulate nonseparable
# classes of points by intermingling a few nearby points across the previously used line.

nearby_indices = (abs.(line.(eachrow(P))) .< 1.1)
labels_new = ifelse.(nearby_indices, -labels, labels)

P_pos = P[labels_new.==1, :]
P_neg = P[labels_new.==-1, :]
@assert size(P_pos, 1) + size(P_neg, 1) == size(P, 1) #src
Plots.scatter!(
    plot_copy,
    P_pos[:, 1],
    P_pos[:, 2];
    shape = :cross,
    markercolor = :blue,
    markersize = 8,
)
Plots.scatter!(
    plot_copy,
    P_neg[:, 1],
    P_neg[:, 2];
    shape = :xcross,
    markercolor = :crimson,
    markersize = 8,
)

model, w_sol, g_sol, y_sol = solve_SVM_classifier(P, labels_new)
Test.@test termination_status(model) == LOCALLY_SOLVED    #src
Test.@test primal_status(model) == FEASIBLE_POINT  #src
println("Minimum slack: ", minimum(y_sol), "\nMaximum slack: ", maximum(y_sol))

# 

Plots.plot!(
    plot_copy,
    x -> line(x; w = w_sol, g = g_sol),
    0.0:0.01:2.0;
    seriestype = :line,
    linewidth = 5,
    linestyle = :dashdotdot,
    lineopacity = 0.9,
    c = :darkblue,
)

# So it still works as a classifier, with allowance for the nonseparable points.
#
# We can find out which points are contributing to the shape of the line by
# looking at the dual values of the affine constraints and comparing them
# to the penalty constant ``C``:

affine_cons = all_constraints(model, AffExpr, MOI.GreaterThan{Float64})
active_cons = findall(isapprox.(dual.(affine_cons), C_0; atol = 0.001))

findall(nearby_indices) âŠ† active_cons

# The last statement tells us that our nonseparable points are actively contributing
# to how the classifier is defined. The remaining points are of interest and
# are highlighted:

P_active = P[setdiff(active_cons, findall(nearby_indices)), :]

Plots.scatter!(
    plot_copy,
    P_active[:, 1],
    P_active[:, 2];
    shape = :hexagon,
    markercolor = :green,
    markersize = 8,
    markeropacity = 0.5,
)
# ## Advanced: Duality and the kernel method

# ### The dual program

# The dual of the linear SVM program is also a linearly constrained quadratic program:
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# \min_{u \in \mathbb{R}^m} \quad & \frac{1}{2} u^\top D P  P^\top D u - \; \mathbf{1}^\top u \\
# \text{subject to } \quad & \mathbf{1}^\top D u = 0  \\
#                   & 0 \leq u \leq C\mathbf{1}.
# \end{aligned}
# ```
# This is the JuMP model:
function solve_dual_SVM_classifier(
    P,
    labels;
    optimizer = Ipopt.Optimizer,
    C = C_0,
)
    m, n = size(P)
    model = Model(optimizer)
    set_silent(model)
    @variable(model, 0 <= u[1:m] <= C)
    D = LinearAlgebra.Diagonal(labels)
    con = @constraint(model, sum(D * u) >= 0)
    @objective(model, Min, 1 / 2 * u' * D * P * P' * D * u - C * sum(u))
    optimize!(model)
    u_sol = value.(u)
    w_sol = P' * D * u_sol
    g_sol = dual(con)
    return model, u_sol, w_sol, g_sol
end

# We recover the line gradient vector ``w`` through setting ``w = P^\top D u``
# and the line constant ``g`` as the dual value of the single affine constraint.
# In many cases it may be simpler to solve the dual form. We can check that this
# has recovered the classifier:

model_dual, u_d, w_d, g_d = solve_dual_SVM_classifier(P, labels)
Test.@test termination_status(model_dual) == LOCALLY_SOLVED    #src
Test.@test primal_status(model_dual) == FEASIBLE_POINT  #src
Plots.plot!(
    plot_copy,
    x -> line(x; w = w_d, g = g_d),
    0.0:0.01:2.0;
    seriestype = :line,
    linewidth = 2,
    linestyle = :dash,
    lineopacity = 0.9,
    c = :red,
)

# ## The kernel method

# Linear SVM techniques are not limited to finding separating hyperplanes
# in the original space of the dataset. One could first transform the 
# training data under a nonlinear mapping, apply our method, then 
# map the hyperplane back into original space.

# The actual data describing the point set is held in a matrix ``P``,
# but looking at the dual program we see that what actually matters is the
# [Gram matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_matrix) ``P P^\top``,
# expressing a pairwise comparison (an inner-product) between each point vector.
# It follows that any mapping of the point set only needs
# to be defined at the level of _pairwise_ maps between points.
# Such maps are known as _kernel functions_
# ```math
# k \; : \; \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \; \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, \qquad
# (s, t) \mapsto \left< \Phi(s), \Phi(t) \right>
# ```
# where the right-hand side applies some transformation ``\Phi : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n'}``
# followed by an inner-product in that image space. In practice, we can avoid having
#  ``\Phi`` explicitly given but instead define a kernel function directly between pairs of vectors.
# This move to using a kernel function without knowing the map is called the _kernel method_
# (or sometimes, the _kernel trick_).

# ### Classifier using a Gaussian kernel

# We will demonstrate the application of a _Gaussian_ or _radial basis function_ kernel
# ```math
# k(s, t)  = \exp\left( -\mu \lVert s - t \rVert^2_2 \right)
# ```
# for some positive parameter ``\mu``.

k_gauss(s::Vector, t::Vector; Î¼ = 0.5) = exp(-Î¼ * LinearAlgebra.norm(s - t)^2)

# Given a matrix of points expressed row-wise and a kernel, let's return
# the transformed matrix ``K`` that replaces ``P P^\top``:

function pairwise_transform(kernel_func, P)
    m, n = size(P)
    K = zeros(eltype(P), m, m)

    for j in 1:m
        for i in 1:j
            K[i, j] = kernel_func(P[i, :], P[j, :])
        end
    end

    return LinearAlgebra.Symmetric(K, :U)
end

K_0 = pairwise_transform(k_gauss, P)

function solve_kernel_SVM_classifier(
    kernel_func,
    P,
    labels;
    optimizer = Ipopt.Optimizer,
    C = C_0,
    kwargs...,
)
    m, n = size(P)
    K = pairwise_transform(kernel_func, P)
    model = Model(optimizer)
    set_silent(model)
    @variable(model, 0 <= u[1:m] <= C)
    D = LinearAlgebra.Diagonal(labels)
    con = @constraint(model, sum(D * u) >= 0)
    @objective(model, Min, 1 / 2 * u' * D * K * D * u - C * sum(u))
    optimize!(model)
    u_sol = value.(u)
    g_sol = dual(con)

    function kernel_classifier(v::Vector)
        return sum(
            D[i, i] * u_sol[i] * kernel_func(P[i, :], v; kwargs...) for i in 1:m
        )
    end

    return model, u_sol, g_sol, kernel_classifier
end

# This time, we don't recover the line gradient vector ``w`` directly.
# Instead, we compute the classifier ``f`` using the dual values and the
# kernel function:
#  ```math
#  f(v) = \sum_{i=1}^m D_{ii} u_i \; k(p_i, v ) - g
# ```
# where ``p_i`` is row vector ``i`` of ``P``.

# ### Checkerboard dataset

# To demonstrate this nonlinear technique, we'll use the [checkerboard dataset](data/checker/README).

checkerboard = DelimitedFiles.readdlm(
    joinpath(@__DIR__, "data", "checker", "checker.txt"),
    ' ',
    Int64,

labels_checker = ifelse.(checkerboard[:, 1] .== 0, -1, 1)
B = checkerboard[:, 2:3] ./ 100.0  # rescale to [0,2] x [0,2] square.
B_pos = B[labels_checker.==1, :]
B_neg = B[labels_checker.==-1, :]
@assert size(B_pos, 1) + size(B_neg, 1) == size(B, 1) #src
r = 1.01 * maximum(abs.(B))
plot_checkers = Plots.scatter(
    B_pos[:, 1],

# Is the technique capable of generating a distinctly nonlinear surface?
# The result has a fairly strong dependence on the choice of parameters:
C_1 = 100_000
Î¼_1 = 20
println("C = ", C_1, ", Î¼ = ", Î¼_1)

# Let's solve the Gaussian kernel based quadratic problem with these parameters:

model_kernel, u_k, g_k, f_gauss =
    solve_kernel_SVM_classifier(k_gauss, B, labels_checker; C = C_1, Î¼ = Î¼_1)
Test.@test termination_status(model_kernel) == LOCALLY_SOLVED    #src
Test.@test primal_status(model_kernel) == FEASIBLE_POINT  #src

grid = [[x, y] for x in 0:0.01:2, y in 0:0.01:2]
grid_pos = grid[f_gauss.(grid).>0]

plot_board = Plots.scatter(
    plot_checkers,
    Tuple.(grid_pos);
    shape = :circle,
    markersize = 0.5,
    markeropacity = 0.8,
    xlim = (0, r),
    ylim = (0, r),
    size = (600, 600),
    legend = false,
)

# We find that the kernel method can perform well as a nonlinear classifier.
# Determining a better performing kernel function or choice of parameters is left as
# a further challenge.
