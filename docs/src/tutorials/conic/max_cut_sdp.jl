# # SDP relaxations: max-cut

# Solves a semidefinite programming relaxation of the MAXCUT graph problem:
#
#     max   0.25 * L•X
#     s.t.  diag(X) == e
#           X ≽ 0
#
# Where `L` is the weighted graph Laplacian. Uses this relaxation to generate a
# solution to the original MAXCUT problem using the method from the paper:
#
# Goemans, M. X., & Williamson, D. P. (1995). Improved approximation algorithms
# for maximum cut and satisfiability problems using semidefinite programming.
# Journal of the ACM (JACM), 42(6), 1115-1145.
