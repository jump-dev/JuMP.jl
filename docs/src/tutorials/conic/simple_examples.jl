# # Simple semidefinite programming examples

# ## Maximum cut via SDP

# The [maximum cut problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_cut) is a
# classical example in graph theory, where we seek to partition a graph into
# two complementary sets, such that the weight of edges between the two sets is
# maximized. This problem is NP-hard, but it is possible to obtain an
# approximate solution using the semidefinite programming relaxation:
# ```math
#     \text{max}  \quad   0.25 L•X \\
#     \text{    s.t.} \quad   \mathrm{diag}(X) = e \\
#                  \qquad X \succeq 0
# ```
# where ``L`` is the weighted graph Laplacian and ``e`` is a vector of ones.
# For more details, see:
#
# Goemans, M. X., & Williamson, D. P. (1995). 
# [_Improved approximation algorithms for maximum cut and satisfiability problems
# using semidefinite programming._](https://doi.org/10.1145/227683.227684)

# ## The minimum distortion problem

# This example arises from computational geometry, in particular the problem of
# embedding a general finite metric space into a Euclidean space.
#
# It is known that the 4-point metric space defined by the star graph
# ```raw
#   [1]
#     \
#      1
#       \
#       [0] —- 1 -- [2]
#       /
#      1
#     /
#   [3]
# ```
# cannot be exactly embedded into a Euclidean space of any dimension,
# where distances are computed by length of the shortest path between vertices.
# A distance-preserving embedding would require the three leaf nodes to form
# an equilateral triangle of side length 2, with the centre node (0) mapped to
# an equidistant point at distance 1; this is impossible since the
# [triangle inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality)
# in Euclidean space implies all points would need to be simultaneously
# [collinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinearity).
#
# Here we will formulate and solve an SDP to compute the best possible embedding,
# that is, the embedding ``f`` assigning each vertex ``v`` to a vector ``f(v)``
# that minimizes the distortion ``c`` such that
# ```math
#     D[a, b] \leq ||f(a) - f(b)|| \leq c \; D[a, b]
# ```
# for all edges ``(a, b)`` in the graph, where ``D[a, b]`` is the distance in the graph metric space.
#
# Any embedding ``f`` can be characterized by a Gram matrix ``Q``, which is PSD and
# such that
# ```math
#     ||f(a) - f(b)||^2 = Q[a, a] + Q[b, b] - 2 Q[a, b]
# ```
# The matrix entry ``Q[a,b]`` represents the inner product of ``f(a)`` with ``f(b)``.
#
# We therefore impose the constraint
# ```math
#     D[a, b]^2 \leq Q[a, a] + Q[b, b] - 2 Q[a, b] \leq c^2 \; D[a, b]^2
# ```
# for all edges ``(a, b)`` in the graph and minimize ``c^2``, 
# which gives us the SDP formulation below.
# Since we may choose any point to be the origin, we fix the first vertex at 0.

# ## Lovász numbers

# The [Lovász number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lov%C3%A1sz_number)
# of a graph, also known as Lovász's theta-function, is a number that
# lies between two important and related numbers that are computationally
# hard to determine, namely the chromatic and clique numbers of the graph.
# It is possible however to efficient compute the Lovász number as the
# optimal value of a semidefinite program.

# Consider the pentagon graph:
# ```raw
#      [5]
#     /   \    
#    /     \     
#  [1]     [4]
#   |       |
#   |       |  
#  [2] --- [3]
# ```
# with five vertices and edges. Its Lovász number is known to be precisely
# ``\sqrt{5} \approx 2.236``, lying between 2 (the largest clique size) and
# 3 (the smallest number needed for a vertex coloring).

# Let ``i, \, j`` be integers such that ``1 \leq i < j \leq 5``.
# We define ``A^{ij}`` to be the ``5 \times 5`` symmetric
# matrix with entries ``(i,j)`` and ``(j,i)`` equal to 1, with all other entries 0.
# Let  ``E`` be the graph's edge set; in this example, ``E`` contains
# (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,1)
# and their transposes. The Lovász number can be computed from the program 
# ```math
# \begin{align}
#     \text{max}      & \quad    J • X & \\
#     \text{    s.t.} & \quad A^{ij} • X = 0 \text{ for all } (i,j) \notin E   \\
#                     & \quad I • X = 1 \\
#                     & \quad X \succeq 0
# \end{align}
# ```
# where ``J`` is the matrix filled with ones, and ``I`` is the identity matrix.
