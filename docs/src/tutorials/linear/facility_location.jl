# # The facility location problem

# **This tutorial was originally contributed by Mathieu Tanneau and Alexis Montoison.**

# ## Required packages

# This tutorial requires the following packages:

using JuMP
import HiGHS
import LinearAlgebra
import Plots
import Random

# ## Uncapacitated facility location

# ### Problem description
#
# We are given
# * A set $M=\{1, \dots, m\}$ of clients
# * A set $N=\{ 1, \dots, n\}$ of sites where a facility can be built
#
# **Decision variables**
# Decision variables are split into two categories:
# * Binary variable $y_{j}$ indicates whether facility $j$ is built or not
# * Binary variable $x_{i, j}$ indicates whether client $i$ is assigned to facility $j$
#
# **Objective**
# The objective is to minimize the total cost of serving all clients.
# This costs breaks down into two components:
# * Fixed cost of building a facility.
# In this example, this cost is $f_{j} = 1, \ \forall j$.
# * Cost of serving clients from the assigned facility.
# In this example, the cost $c_{i, j}$
# of serving client $i$ from facility $j$
# is the Euclidean distance between the two.
#
# **Constraints**
# * Each customer must be served by exactly one facility
# * A facility cannot serve any client unless it is open

# ### MILP formulation
#
# The problem can be formulated as the following MILP:
#
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# \min_{x, y} \ \ \ &
# \sum_{i, j} c_{i, j} x_{i, j} +
# \sum_{j} f_{j} y_{j} \\
# s.t. &
# \sum_{j} x_{i, j} = 1, && \forall i \in M \\
# & x_{i, j} \leq y_{j}, && \forall i \in M, j \in N \\
# & x_{i, j}, y_{j} \in \{0, 1\}, && \forall i \in M, j \in N
# \end{aligned}
# ```
#
# where the first set of constraints ensures
# that each client is served exactly once,
# and the second set of constraints ensures
# that no client is served from an unopened facility.

# ### Problem data

# To ensure reproducibility, we set the random number seed:

Random.seed!(314)

# Here's the data we need:

## Number of clients
m = 12
## Number of facility locations
n = 5

## Clients' locations
x_c, y_c = rand(m), rand(m)

## Facilities' potential locations
x_f, y_f = rand(n), rand(n)

## Fixed costs
f = ones(n);

## Distance
c = zeros(m, n)
for i in 1:m
    for j in 1:n
        c[i, j] = LinearAlgebra.norm([x_c[i] - x_f[j], y_c[i] - y_f[j]], 2)
    end
end

# Display the data
Plots.scatter(
    x_c,
    y_c;
    label = "Clients",
    markershape = :circle,
    markercolor = :blue,
)
Plots.scatter!(
    x_f,
    y_f;
    label = "Facility",
    markershape = :square,
    markercolor = :white,
    markersize = 6,
    markerstrokecolor = :red,
    markerstrokewidth = 2,
)

# ### JuMP implementation

# Create a JuMP model
model = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)
set_silent(model)
@variable(model, y[1:n], Bin);
@variable(model, x[1:m, 1:n], Bin);
## Each client is served exactly once
@constraint(model, client_service[i in 1:m], sum(x[i, j] for j in 1:n) == 1);
## A facility must be open to serve a client
@constraint(model, open_facility[i in 1:m, j in 1:n], x[i, j] <= y[j]);
@objective(model, Min, f' * y + sum(c .* x));

# Solve the uncapacitated facility location problem with HiGHS

optimize!(model)
println("Optimal value: ", objective_value(model))

# ### Visualizing the solution

# The threshold 1e-5 ensure that edges between clients and facilities are drawn
# when `x[i, j] ≈ 1`.
x_is_selected = isapprox.(value.(x), 1; atol = 1e-5);

# ## Capacitated facility location

# ### Problem formulation
#
# The capacitated variant introduces a capacity constraint on each facility,
# that is, clients have a certain level of demand to be served, while each facility
# only has finite capacity which cannot be exceeded.
#
# Specifically,
# * The demand of client $i$ is denoted by $a_{i} \geq 0$
# * The capacity of facility $j$ is denoted by $q_{j} \geq 0$
#
# The capacity constraints then write
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# \sum_{i} a_{i} x_{i, j} &\leq q_{j} y_{j} && \forall j \in N
# \end{aligned}
# ```
#
# Note that, if $y_{j}$ is set to $0$, the capacity constraint above
# automatically forces $x_{i, j}$ to $0$.

# Thus, the capacitated facility location can be formulated as follows
#
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# \min_{x, y} \ \ \ &
# \sum_{i, j} c_{i, j} x_{i, j} +
# \sum_{j} f_{j} y_{j} \\
# s.t. &
# \sum_{j} x_{i, j} = 1, && \forall i \in M \\
# & \sum_{i} a_{i} x_{i, j} \leq q_{j} y_{j}, && \forall j \in N \\
# & x_{i, j}, y_{j} \in \{0, 1\}, && \forall i \in M, j \in N
# \end{aligned}
# ```
#
# For simplicity, we will assume that there is enough capacity to serve the
# demand, that is, there exists at least one feasible solution.

# We need some new data:

## Demands
a = rand(1:3, m);

## Capacities
q = rand(5:10, n);

# Display the data
Plots.scatter(
    x_c,
    y_c;
    label = nothing,
    markershape = :circle,

    markersize = 2 .* (2 .+ a),
)

Plots.scatter!(
    x_f,

    markerstrokewidth = 2,
