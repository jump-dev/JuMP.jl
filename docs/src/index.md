!!! warning
    Between versions 0.18 and 0.19, JuMP underwent a major transition in its
    underlying solver abstraction API, from
    [MathProgBase](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathProgBase.jl) to
    [MathOptInterface](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl).
    See [NEWS.md](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/blob/master/NEWS.md) for
    a comprehensive list of changes between the two versions, many of which
    are breaking. This documentation is for JuMP/MathOptInterface.
    For the documentation of JuMP 0.18, see
    [here](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/0.18/).

## What is JuMP?

[JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) is a domain-specific modeling
language for [mathematical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization)
embedded in [Julia](https://julialang.org/). It currently supports a number of
open-source and commercial solvers for a variety of problem classes, including
linear, mixed-integer, second-order conic, semidefinite, and nonlinear
programming.

!!! tip
    If you aren't sure if you should use JuMP, read [Should I use JuMP?](@ref).

## Resources for getting started

* Read the [Installation Guide](@ref).
* Read the introductory tutorials [Getting started with Julia](@ref) and
  [Getting started with JuMP](@ref).
* Browse some of our modeling tutorials, including classics such as
  [The diet problem](@ref), or the [Maximum likelihood estimation](@ref) problem
  using nonlinear programming.

    Before asking a question, make sure to read the post [make it easier to help you](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/psa-make-it-easier-to-help-you/14757),
    which contains a number of tips on how to ask a good question.

## How the documentation is structured

Having a high-level overview of how this documentation is structured will help
you know where to look for certain things.

* **Tutorials** contain worked examples of solving problems with JuMP. Start
  here if you are new to JuMP, or you have a particular problem class you want
  to model.

* The **Manual** contains short code-snippets that explain how to achieve
  specific tasks in JuMP. Look here if you want to know how to achieve a
  particular task, such as how to [Delete a variable](@ref delete_a_variable) or
  how to [Modify an objective coefficient](@ref).

* The **API Reference** contains a complete list of the functions you can use in
  JuMP. Look here if you want to know how to use a particular function.

* The **Background information** section contains background reading material to
  provide context to JuMP. Look here if you want an understanding of what JuMP
  is and why we created it, rather than how to use it.

* The **Developer docs** section contains information for people contributing to
  JuMP development or writing JuMP extensions. Don't worry about this section if
  you are just using JuMP to formulate and solve problems as a user.

* The **MathOptInterface** section is a self-contained copy of the documentation
  for MathOptInterface. Look here for functions and constants beginning with
  `MOI.`, as well as for general information on how MathOptInterface works.
