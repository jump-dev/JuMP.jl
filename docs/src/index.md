Welcome to the documentation for JuMP.

!!! note
    This documentation is also available in PDF format: [JuMP.pdf](JuMP.pdf).

## What is JuMP?

[JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) is a domain-specific modeling
language for [mathematical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization)
embedded in [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

JuMP makes it easy to formulate and solve a range of problem classes, including
linear programs, integer programs, conic programs, semidefinite programs, and
constrained nonlinear programs. Hereâ€™s an example:

```julia
julia> using JuMP, Ipopt

julia> function solve_constrained_least_squares_regression(A::Matrix, b::Vector)
           m, n = size(A)
           model = Model(Ipopt.Optimizer)
           set_silent(model)
           @variable(model, x[1:n])
           @variable(model, residuals[1:m])
           @constraint(model, residuals == A * x - b)
           @constraint(model, sum(x) == 1)
           @objective(model, Min, sum(residuals.^2))
           optimize!(model)
           return value.(x)
       end
solve_constrained_least_squares_regression (generic function with 1 method)

julia> A, b = rand(10, 3), rand(10);

julia> x = solve_constrained_least_squares_regression(A, b)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.4137624719002825
 0.09707679853084578

```

!!! tip
    If you aren't sure if you should use JuMP, read [Should you use JuMP?](@ref).

## Resources for getting started

There are a few ways to get started with JuMP:

* Read the [Installation Guide](@ref).
* Read the introductory tutorials [Getting started with Julia](@ref) and
  [Getting started with JuMP](@ref).
* Browse some of our modeling tutorials, including classics such as
  [The diet problem](@ref), or the [Maximum likelihood estimation](@ref) problem
  using nonlinear programming.

    Before asking a question, make sure to read the post [make it easier to help you](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/psa-make-it-easier-to-help-you/14757),
    which contains a number of tips on how to ask a good question.

## How the documentation is structured

Having a high-level overview of how this documentation is structured will help
you know where to look for certain things.

* **Tutorials** contain worked examples of solving problems with JuMP. Start
  here if you are new to JuMP, or you have a particular problem class you want
  to model.

* The **Manual** contains short code-snippets that explain how to achieve
  specific tasks in JuMP. Look here if you want to know how to achieve a
  particular task, such as how to [Delete a variable](@ref delete_a_variable) or
  how to [Modify an objective coefficient](@ref).

* The **API Reference** contains a complete list of the functions you can use in
  JuMP. Look here if you want to know how to use a particular function.

* The **Background information** section contains background reading material to
  provide context to JuMP. Look here if you want an understanding of what JuMP
  is and why we created it, rather than how to use it.

* The **Developer docs** section contains information for people contributing to
  JuMP development or writing JuMP extensions. Don't worry about this section if
  you are using JuMP to formulate and solve problems as a user.

* The **MathOptInterface** section is a self-contained copy of the documentation
  for MathOptInterface. Look here for functions and constants beginning with
  `MOI.`, as well as for general information on how MathOptInterface works.

JuMP is a Sponsored Project of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity in the
United States. NumFOCUS provides JuMP with fiscal, legal, and administrative
support to help ensure the health and sustainability of the project. Visit
[numfocus.org](https://numfocus.org) for more information.

You can support JuMP by [donating](https://numfocus.org/donate-to-jump).

Donations to JuMP are managed by NumFOCUS. For donors in the United States,
your gift is tax-deductible to the extent provided by law. As with any donation,
you should consult with your tax adviser about your particular tax situation.

JuMP's largest expense is the annual JuMP-dev workshop. Donations will help us
provide travel support for JuMP-dev attendees and take advantage of other
opportunities that arise to support JuMP development.
