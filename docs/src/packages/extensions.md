# Introduction

This section of the documentation contains brief documentation for some popular
JuMP extensions. The list of extensions is not exhaustive, but instead is
intended to help you discover popular JuMP extensions, and to give you an
overview of the types of extensions that are possible to write with JuMP.

## Affiliation

Packages beginning with `jump-dev/` are developed and maintained by the
JuMP developers.

Packages that do not begin with `jump-dev/` are developed independently, and the
JuMP developers have no affiliation with their developers or control over their
contents. The README files from each solver are taken directly from the GitHub
repository of each package. They are included here for the benefit of users
reading a single unified set of documentation.

## Adding new extensions

Written an extension? Add it to this section of the JuMP documentation by making
a pull request to the [`docs/packages.toml`](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/blob/master/docs/packages.toml)
file.
