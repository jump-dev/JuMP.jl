# Introduction

This section of the documentation contains brief documentation for some popular
JuMP extensions. The list of extensions is not exhaustive, but instead is
intended to help you discover popular JuMP extensions, and to give you an
overview of the types of extensions that are possible to write with JuMP.

Packages beginning with `jump-dev/` are developed and maintained by the
JuMP developers. Other packages are developed independently.
