# Introduction

This section of the documentation contains brief documentation for some of the
solvers that JuMP supports. The list of solvers is not exhaustive, but instead
is intended to help you discover commonly used solvers.

## Affiliation

Packages beginning with `jump-dev/` are developed and maintained by the
JuMP developers. In many cases, these packages wrap external solvers that are
not developed by the JuMP developers and, while the Julia packages are all
open-source, in some cases the solvers themselves are closed source commercial
products.

Packages that do not begin with `jump-dev/` are developed independently. The
developers of these packages requested or consented to the inclusion of their
README contents in the JuMP documentation for the benefit of users.

## Adding new solvers

file.
