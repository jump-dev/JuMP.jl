# Introduction

This section of the documentation contains brief documentation for some of the
solvers that JuMP supports. The list of solvers is not exhaustive, but instead
is intended to help you discover commonly used solvers.

Packages beginning with `jump-dev/` are developed and maintained by the
JuMP developers. Other packages are developed independently.
